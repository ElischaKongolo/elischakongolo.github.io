💭 **My Development Philosophy**

"The obstacle is the way. Every bug 🐛, every missed deadline ⏰, every unclear requirement ❓ is not a barrier to success—it's the precise terrain where success is earned."

In short: I'm a builder 🏗️. I build systems 💻, I build teams 👥, and most importantly, I build the resilience 💪 needed to see hard things through.
